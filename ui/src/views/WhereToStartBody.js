## How Do I do all of that stuff?

- Organize all of your projects.
- Install Docker on your local machine
- Acquire AWS Account
- Combine the above
- Profit!


### Organize all of your projects.

Gather all of your _web-based_ projects and put them into one of two categories:

- Static Content
- Web Services

#### Static Content
Just a simple html based application that may or may not have a corresponding backend/REST API.

#### Web Services
Projects that run on/are servers and normally are accessed from \`localhost:8080\` or something like that.
These may or may not serve static content as well

**The distinction between these two categories is the amount of $$ you will spend*

### Install Docker on your local machine
### Acquire AWS Account
### Combine the above
### Profit!
